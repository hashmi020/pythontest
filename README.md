🧮 Task 3: Factorial Calculator
🔹 Description
This program defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop or recursion.

✅ Features:
Takes a sample number (or can be modified to accept user input).

Uses a for loop to compute the factorial.

Returns the result from the function and displays it.

📌 Sample Output
csharp
Copy
Edit
The factorial of 5 is: 120
Optional: The same functionality can also be implemented using recursion.

📐 Task 4: Math Module Calculations
🔹 Description
This program prompts the user to enter a number and uses Python’s built-in math module to compute:

Square root

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine of the number (in radians)

✅ Features:
Accepts float input from the user.

Uses math.sqrt(), math.log(), and math.sin() functions.

Displays results with informative labels.

📌 Sample Output
yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 2

Calculated Results:
Square root of 2.0 = 1.4142135623730951
Natural logarithm (ln) of 2.0 = 0.6931471805599453
Sine of 2.0 (radians) = 0.9092974268256817
⚠️ Note: This program assumes the input is a positive number, as negative values are not valid for sqrt and log.
